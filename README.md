**Automatic Teamlist Filler**

## Usage

This software fills a Team List form directly from console. Plug your cart and it will export infos from the **first Battle Box**.

You can find the exported Team List in your console's **SD card**, at **`/vgc/VGC18-YYYYMMDD-NameSurname.png`**. You'll only need to print it.

Always **double check** and **make sure that the dumped data are coherent with your in-game team**! 

***I'm NOT RESPONSIBLE if something will mismatch and you'll get penalizations during the tournament. Always DOUBLE CHECK!***
